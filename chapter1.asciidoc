Introducing Android
-------------------

In order to write applications for Android, it helps to understand more about
the platform as a whole.  It is not necessary to know intimately the details
of the Android platform, being familiar with the platform will help you
understand many of the features you can use in your application, as well as
some of the limitations you will face.

If you are eager to get started, feel free to skim over this chapter and move

=== What is Android?

What is _Android_?  Although the term is used in many contexts, it is most
common to refer to Android as a mobile operating system that competes with
other platforms such as Apple's iOS, Nokia's Symbian, or Research in Motion's
Blackberry.  The developer documentation defines Android as `a software stack
for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key
applications'footnote:[http://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html].
In the next section, you will learn in greater detail what this means.


.A brief history of Android
********************************************************************************
(((Android, history)))
Android was created by Andy Rubin and started out as Android, Inc. in 2003.
Google acquired the company in 2005 and made Rubin its Senior Vice President
of Mobile.  Google developed Android secretly for a couple of years, and in
November 2007, Android was formally unveiled by the Open Handset Alliance, a
consortium of software companies, mobile operators, chip manufacturers, and
other companies.

The first commercial handset using Android was the T-Mobile G1, released in
October 2008, and it used Android 1.0.  It was upgraded to Android 1.1 in
February 2009.  Subsequent releases of Android are commonly referred to by
their nicknames, as follow:

* _Cupcake_, version 1.5, released April 2009
* _Donut_, version 1.6, released September 2009
* _Eclair_, initially released in September 2009 as version 2.0, and then
  later updated to version 2.0.1 in December 2009 and version 2.1 in January
  2010
* _Froyo_ (frozen yoghurt), version 2.2, released May 2010
* _Gingerbread_, version 2.3, released in December 2010 and later updated to
  2.3.3 in February 2011
* _Honeycomb_, version 3.0, released February 2011 and updated to version 3.1
  in May 2011

The growth of Android's market share has been remarkable.  It's share has
grown from 3.8% in November 2009 to being the leader at 36.4% in April 2011.
In June 2011, Google claimed that 500,000 new Android devices were being
activated each day.

=== Anatomy of an Android

indextermstart:android_arch[Android,architecture]
The Android platform is a massive collection of open source software programs
and libraries.  This software is organised into five general groups layered as
seen in <<fig.android_architecture>>.  From the bottom up, these are:

. The _Linux kernel_ provides the fundamental functionality for the platform,
  such as an abstraction of the hardware, the security mechanism, and a
  networking stack.
. The _system libraries_ are an assortment of open source libraries that
  provide higher level functionality such as an embedded relational database,
  a web page renderer, and a 3D graphics library
. The _Android runtime_ is the basic container that runs all other Android
  components, such as applications and background services. 
. The _application framework_ consists of all the different programming
  interfaces that are available to you as an application developer.
. Finally, Android _applications_ are what users see and what you can develop.

As an application developer, you will generally not need to worry about the
lower layers.  However, if you were interesting in modifying the Android
platform or porting it to a new device, all of the code is available from the
Android Open Source Project{empty}footnote:[http://source.android.com].

.How open is Android?
********************************************************************************
One of the biggest selling points of Android is that is an open source
project.  Google publishes the full source code to the platform under the
Apache Software License 2.0, a permissive license that is friendly to
commercial development.  Google also provides a bug tracker and a process for
accepting patches for third-party developers.

However, unlike many other open source projects, Google generally develops new
versions of the platform privately.  Google publishes a new version of the
platform only once devices that use it start shipping.  However, Google did
not release the full source code of the Honeycomb release for tablet
computers, which garnered much criticism from open source software advocates.
Google plans to continue its practice of releasing the full platform source
code with the next release, Ice Cream Sandwich.
********************************************************************************

==== The Linux Kernel

A kernel is the core of a computer operating system and provides many of the
most basic resources needed by programs running on the computer, such as
managing memory and processes.  The Linux kernel was developed by Linus
Trovalds in 1991 and has since grown to be one of the most ubiquitous kernels
in use today.  It is found on most of the world's most powerful supercomputers
and runs much of the Internet.  The Linux kernel also scales down to small
devices such as wireless routers, e-book readers, and even smart phones from
Android's competitors.

In addition to the most basic functions, the Linux kernel also provides a
robust permission-based security model, a networking stack, file system
support, and support for shared libraries.  In order to support specific
hardware, manufacturers write drivers that are compiled into the kernel and
abide by standard interfaces.  This allows the rest of the platform to be
written without needing to know the specific details of the hardware on which
it is running.

Android has also includes a number of modifications to the Linux kernel to
tailor it to the platform as a whole.  Some of these modifications include a
specialised shared memory mechanism, a lightweight inter-process communication
protocol, and an enhanced power management subsystem.


==== System libraries

The next level up from the kernel is made up of the various system libraries
included in the platform and written in either C or C\++.  Many of these
libraries come from other open source projects and are commonly included in
Linux distributions, and others were created especially for Android.  Some of
these libraries include:

Bionic::
  Bionic is a C library derived from the C libraries from various Berkeley
  Software Distribution (BSD) distributions.  It is tuned for embedded
  systems by being particularly small and efficient.  It also supports some of
  Android's unique features, but neither adheres fully to the POSIX standard
  nor is compatible with all of the GNU C library extensions.

WebKit::
  Android includes WebKit, a popular layout engine that is also used browsers
  such as Chrome and Safari.  It fully supports the latest HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript standards.  Like many other components, Android's WebKit
  implementation is tweaked for the platform.

SQLite::
  Android supports SQLite, an extremely popular and lightweight relational
  database management system.  Available to all applications, it allows
  data to stored in a relational database and queried using SQL.

Media libraries::
  Android supports large number of media capabilities, such as displaying
  images, playing audio or video, and taking pictures or recording video from
  the camera.  The media libraries do the heavy lifting to make all of this
  possible.

Surface manager::
  Android applications can support both 2D and 3D user interfaces, and several
  applications may run at the same time.  The surface manager is in charge of
  composing all of these different interfaces and displaying the result to the
  user.

Audio flinger::
  What the surface manager is to the display, the audio flinger is to the
  audio outputs.  The audio flinger not only mixes the audio from the
  different possible sources, such as the telephone or a media player, but is
  also in charge of making sure the audio is played via the right device, such
  as the built-in speaker or a Bluetooth headset.

Hardware abstraction layer::
  Although the Linux kernel does provide a good abstraction layer for many
  drivers, in some cases this layer is too complex or does not exist for
  certain types of devices.  To resolve this problem, Android has an
  additional abstraction layer.
  

.Is Android Linux?
********************************************************************************
Android makes use of the Linux kernel and many of the same system libraries
found on Linux distributions such as Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, or Ubuntu.
Nonetheless, there are some key differences that keep Android from fully being
a true 'Linux'.

For example, most Linux distributions use the fully-featured GNU C library and
a suite of standard utilities.  Embedded Linux distributions often use the
smaller uClibc C library and BusyBox as a lean replacement for many of the
standard utilities.  However, Android uses its own Bionic C library and
Toolbox utility suite, neither of which support all of the features necessary
for a general-purpose Linux system.
********************************************************************************

==== Android runtime

The Android runtime is the component that has the greatest impact on Android
application development.  It consists of two parts: the
Dalvik{empty}footnote:[Dalvik is named after the fishing village of Dalv√≠k in
Eyjafj√∂r√µur, Iceland] Virtual Machine (VM) and a set of core libraries.  Your
application will run in an instance of the runtime and you must compile your
code to a format that is compatible with the Dalvik VM.

.What is a virtual machine?
********************************************************************************
Most programming languages that are compiled into a machine-readable form are
compiled into a form that is specific to a particular type of platform.  This
provides very good performance but also means that it cannot run on different
platforms without being recompiled.

A virtual machine (VM) provides a high-level abstraction of the underlying
hardware.  As a result, a program compiled for a given virtual machine can be
platform-independent.  To support a new platform, only a new virtual machine
implementation needs to created for that platform.

Java promised to be ‚Äòwrite once, run anywhere‚Äô based on the fact that Java
programs are compiled for the Java VM, which has been implemented for a wide
range of computers.  Other languages also use a virtual machine.  For example,
in Microsoft's .NET framework, languages such as C# and VB.NET compile into
Common Intermediate Language, which is executed by a virtual machine.
********************************************************************************

===== The Dalvik VM

Android uses a virtual machine so an application may be written and compiled
once and still run on every Android device, regardless of the underlying
hardware.  Google decided to create its own virtual machine, the Dalvik VM, as
a clean-room implementation of the Java VM (JVM) optimised for embedded
devices.  It is designed to run in multiple processes, minimise memory use,
and be highly-optimised for the CPU.

To achieve these goals, the Dalvik VM differs from the JVM in one particularly
important aspect: Instead of using Java's standard compiled format, it uses
its own format, the Dalvik Executable (DEX).  The path from a source file to a
DEX file is outlined in <<fig.dx_process>>.

The Java compiler transforms source code into a number of class files, each
one of which represents an individual class.  These class files are made up of
JVM bytecodes which the JVM interprets into a format executable by the native
hardware.  Java applications and libraries generally consist of many class
files and are usually packaged into Java Archive (JAR) files.

Android provides a tool that takes individual class files and JAR files and
converts these into a DEX file.  This process consists largely of two parts:
finding and consolidating shared structures between the different class files
and converting the Java byte codes into Dalvik byte codes.  The result is a
single file that can be run by the Dalvik VM and is usually much smaller than
the original.

===== The core libraries

The second part of the Android runtime are the core libraries, which provide
most of the libraries from the standard edition of the Java programming
language.

[NOTE]
If you are already familiar with the APIs from Java SE, Android's core libraries
will be very familiar to you.  However, be aware that there are some APIs in
Java that are not available in Android, and others which may behave
differently in Android.  Always check the Android API reference to be sure
that Android supports what you would like to do.
