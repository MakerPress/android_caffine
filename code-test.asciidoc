Adding the code by reference stuffs it in an `<img>` tag, but +++<a
href="code/core/hello-android/HelloActivity.scala">linking to the code manually
works</a>+++:

[[code/core/hello-android/HelloActivity.scala]]

The following works:

```clojure
(println "Hello, world!")
```

The following does not:

[source,clojure]
----
(println "Hello, world!")
----


This doesn't even render.
